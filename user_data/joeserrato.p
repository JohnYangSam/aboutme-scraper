S"I'm a baseball, music and hat nerd. 19 year old CSUEB sophomore. Born and raised in Northern California as an A's fan, which is rarer than one would think. I write for two blogs. One is thequasiwriter.weebly.com, which is where I store my think pieces, poems, rough drafts, and whatever else comes to mind. It's my online journal. The other blog is sleepingprospects.weebly.com, which focuses on minor league baseball players that don't get the same recognition more revered players get. Yes, I am wearing a top hat."
