S'My name is Neli. I\'m the seventh woman in a family of nine members. Presently I am married I have three children and three grandchildren whom I love, and they are all for me. At this time I\'m trying to finish an associate in education; which has been very difficult for me because English is not my first language, and to be honest learning it is difficult. When I lived in Mexico during the time that I was at school I was always curious about United States, and learning the language spoken here, but at that time it was impossible to come because I didn\'t have the money to come. When I was thirteen years of age one of my sisters; who lived in the United States had a baby, and my mother asked me to go over to the United States to help her. When my mom told me that she had already bought me a ticket to travel I didn\'t know if I really wanted to go. I think that at that time I didn\'t want to go because I had to leave all my friends, my family, my school, and my room behind. It was really hard I was just a girl. The night I had to leave I felt very sad, but there was nothing I could do I had to obey. From that day on my life changed. I can still remember the smell of the wet earth at dawn in that old town that does not exist in the maps.It was not safe for a teenager to be traveling alone at that time, and it was very difficult. I still remember my mother saying everything would be ok, and that soon I would return. At the time of farewell I could breathe an atmosphere of uncertainty. The cold wind brushed against my face, and my feet were completely frozen. In those times it was imposibble to use a pair of pants or socks for women. I was wearing a long dress and a pair of sandals. My stomach began making unusual sounds because the previous day I had not tasted not even a piece of bread perhaps it was my nerves. Then someone yelled out "in three minutes we leave our truck was delayed and we have counted time to reach the next station". It seemed as if time stood still at that moment. All fell silent, people ran in a hurry from one place to another. I told my mother that I didn\'t want to travel I wanted to stay. She looked at me and started to cry she grabbed me and gave me a long hug. It felt as if hours had passed when finally I told her not to worry i would only be gone for 2 months exactly how long my school vacation lasted. She just nodded to let me know she agreed. We said our goodbyes it was a very significant moment for both of us. I felt strang'
